# HiGlass Server API Documentation

Welcome to the HiGlass Server API documentation. This documentation provides detailed information for developers working with the HiGlass server, focusing on its data models, ingestion processes, and API endpoints, particularly concerning tilesets.

## Navigation

- **[Data Model](./data_model.md)**: Understand the core entities like Tilesets, Projects, and Users.
- **[Data Ingestion](./ingestion.md)**: Learn how to ingest data into the HiGlass server, primarily using the command-line tools.

The HiGlass Server supports [HiGlass](https://github.com/higlass/higlass) and [HiPiler](https://github.com/flekschas/hipiler) by providing APIs for accessing and uploading tiles generated by [Clodius](https://github.com/higlass/clodius).
